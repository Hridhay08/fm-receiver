Main:
	Begin at 106.5MHz.
	infinite loop:
		Perform downward run till reaching within 87.1 and 87 MHz. Once between 87.1 MHz and 87 MHz, clamp it to 87 MHz. Any further change, break out from function.
		Then, perform upward run till reaching within 106.4 and 106.5 MHz. Once between 106.4 and 106.5, clamp it to 106.5. Any further change, break out from function.
	end loop

Downward run:
	Wait till potentiometer at one of the extremes 0 and 1023. Register when potentiometer reaches the extreme, and note it.
	Take chunks of 0.8 MHz starting from 106.5 MHz.
	Divide the scope from extreme to extreme into 8 checkpoints. with each checkpoint, associate a particular frequency, 0.1MHz from previous.
	loop:
		if potentiometer is at a checkpoint within 0.1MHz of 87 MHz, clamp to 87 MHz.
		if potentiometer is at a checkpoint that says less than 87 MHz, break from loop.
		if potentiometer reaches the other extreme, jump back to beginning of loop, take the next lower 0.8 MHz chunk, change to opposite extreme, repeat.
		otherwise, if potentiometer crosses a checkpoint and is "behind" the other checkpoint, tune to that frequency.
	end loop

Upward run:
	Wait till potentiometer at one of the extremes 0 and 1023. Register when potentiometer reaches the extreme, and note it.
	Take chunks of 0.8 MHz starting from 87MHz MHz.
	Divide the scope from extreme to extreme into 8 checkpoints. with each checkpoint, associate a particular frequency, 0.1MHz from previous.
	loop:
		if potentiometer is at a checkpoint within 0.1MHz of 106.5 MHz, clamp to 106.5 MHz.
		if potentiometer is at a checkpoint that says greater than 106.5MHz, break from loop.
		if potentiometer reaches the other extreme, jump back to beginning of loop, take the next upper 0.8 MHz chunk, change to opposite extreme, repeat.
		otherwise, if potentiometer crosses a checkpoint and is "behind" the other checkpoint, tune to that frequency.
